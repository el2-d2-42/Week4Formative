        <h3>Fraud detection</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Machine learning is a pivotal tool for fraud detection in the financial sector. It involves developing and training machine learning algorithms on historical data to identify patterns and characteristics associated with fraudulent activities.
            These algorithms are capable of analysing vast datasets, including transaction histories and user behavior, in real-time. By recognising anomalies or deviations from established patterns, machine learning algorithms generate alerts for potentially fraudulent transactions.
            This proactive approach not only safeguards financial institutions and payment processors from unauthorized activities but also maintains trust and integrity within the financial system. Machine learning has revolutionised fraud detection,
            enabling financial institutions to swiftly mitigate risks and protect consumers from financial losses.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            They can also adapt to evolving fraud tactics. As fraudsters modify their strategies,
            machine learning systems learn to detect these changes and update their algorithms accordingly,
            making it difficult for fraudsters to outsmart the system.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Furthermore, they are used to assess user behavior patterns.
            By considering factors like the speed and rhythm of keystrokes, the angle at which a user holds a device,
            and the typical locations from which transactions occur, these systems can detect discrepancies that might signal fraudulent activity.

        <div style="max-width: 1200px">
        <h3>Credit scoring and risk assessments</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Computer-based credit scoring, facilitated by algorithms and data analysis, has streamlined the risk assessment process, replacing time-consuming manual reviews of applicants' financial histories.
            This approach allows for the rapid and accurate evaluation of creditworthiness, which is particularly beneficial for individuals facing unforeseen expenses or small businesses in need of swift access to capital.
            It reduces the time required to make lending decisions, ensuring that financial assistance can be provided promptly when needed.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Traditional credit scoring, which heavily relies on an applicant's credit history, can pose a barrier to individuals with limited or no conventional credit records. 
            This includes young adults, immigrants, and those who prefer cash transactions over credit.
            Computer-based credit scoring addresses this issue by incorporating alternative data sources, such as rent payments, utility bills, online shopping history, and even social media behaviour.
            By analysing a wider range of data, these algorithms make it possible to assess the creditworthiness of individuals who might have been overlooked by traditional credit scoring models.
            This more inclusive approach not only benefits underserved populations but also promotes economic growth by enabling a broader segment of the population to participate in the financial system,
            make investments, and support entrepreneurial endeavours.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Computerised credit scoring systems, focusing on objective data, eliminate human bias in lending decisions, ensuring fairness and equal treatment in the lending process,
            based on financial responsibility rather than irrelevant factors.
        </p>

        <div style="max-width: 1200px">
            <h3>Personal investment applications</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Computer science has enabled the automation of various financial tasks, such as budgeting, portfolio management, and transaction tracking. Personal finance management apps use algorithms to categorise expenses,
            set financial goals, and optimise investments, making these processes more efficient and less time-consuming for individuals. Computer science algorithms can personalise financial advice based on an individual's financial goals,
            risk tolerance, and current financial situation. Robo-advisors and financial planning apps use these algorithms to provide tailored investment strategies, helping users optimise their investments and build wealth more effectively.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Investment apps have made it easier for a broader range of people to invest in financial markets. These apps often have lower investment minimums and provide access to fractional shares,
            allowing individuals with limited capital to participate in the stock market and build diversified portfolios. This not only encourages saving and investing but also helps individuals build wealth over time.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
            Mobile applications have made it possible for individuals, especially in underserved or remote areas, to access basic banking services. These apps allow people to check balances, make payments, transfer money, and even access microloans using their smartphones.
            Mobile banking apps have become a bridge to the traditional banking sector, giving individuals who were previously unbanked or underbanked access to financial services.
