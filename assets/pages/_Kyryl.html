        <p>
            Artificial intelligence in medicine is the use of machine learning models to search medical data and uncover insights to help improve health outcomes and patient experiences. Thanks to recent advances in computer science and informatics, artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an integral part of modern healthcare. Here are some interesting contributions of AI on medecine:
        </p>
        <h3>
            Disease detection and diagnosis
        </h3>
        <p>
            Unlike humans, AI never needs to sleep. Machine learning models could be used to observe the vital signs of patients receiving critical care and alert clinicians if certain risk factors increase. While medical devices like heart monitors can track vital signs, AI can collect the data from those devices and look for more complex conditions, such as sepsis. One IBM client has developed a predictive AI model for premature babies that is 75% accurate in detecting severe sepsis.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Medical imaging
        </h3>
        <p>
            AI is already playing a prominent role in medical imaging. Research has indicated that AI powered by artificial neural networks can be just as effective as human radiologists at detecting signs of breast cancer as well as other conditions. In addition to helping clinicians spot early signs of disease, AI can also help make the staggering number of medical images that clinicians have to keep track of more manageable by detecting vital pieces of a patient's history and presenting the relevant images to them.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Accelerated drug development
        </h3>
        <p>
            Drug discovery is often one of the longest and most costly parts of drug development. AI could help reduce the costs of developing new medicines in primarily two ways: creating better drug designs and finding promising new drug combinations. With AI, many of the big data challenges facing the life sciences industry could be overcome.

        <img src="../images/finance.webp">
        <p>
            Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in finance encompasses everything from chatbot assistants to fraud detection and task automation. Most banks (80%) are highly aware of the potential benefits presented by AI, according to Insider Intelligenceâ€™s AI in Banking report. The decision for financial institutions (FIs) to adopt AI will be accelerated by technological advancement, increased user acceptance, and shifting regulatory frameworks. Banks using AI can streamline tedious processes and vastly improve the customer experience by offering 24/7 access to their accounts and financial advice services. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Personal Finance
        </h3>
        <p>
            Consumers are hungry for financial independence, and providing the ability to manage one's financial health is the driving force behind adoption of AI in. Whether offering 24/7 financial guidance via chatbots powered by natural language processing or personalizing insights for wealth management solutions, AI is a necessity for any financial institution looking to be a top player in the industry.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Consumer Finance
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of the most significant business cases for AI in finance is its ability to prevent fraud and cyberattacks. Consumers look for banks and other financial services that provide secure accounts, especially with online payment fraud losses expected to jump to $48 billion per year by 2023, according to Insider Intelligence. AI has the ability to analyze and single-out irregularities in patterns that would otherwise go unnoticed by humans.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Corporate Finance
        </h3>
        <p>
            AI is particularly helpful in corporate finance as it can better predict and assess loan risks. For companies looking to increase their value, AI technologies such as machine learning can help improve loan underwriting and reduce financial risk. AI can also lessen financial crime through advanced fraud detection and spot anomalous activity as company accountants, analysts, treasurers, and investors work toward long-term growth.
        </p>

        <h1>AI in software development</h1>
        <img src="../images/soft dev.webp">

        <p>
            AI has significantly impacted the software development landscape in recent years, bringing about several notable changes and advancements. Here are some ways in which AI has influenced software development:
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Automation and productivity</h3>
        <p>
            AI has enabled automation of various software development tasks, boosting productivity and efficiency. For example, AI-powered tools can automatically generate code snippets, perform code refactoring, and assist in bug detection and fixing. This automation helps developers save time and focus on more complex and critical aspects of software development.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Intelligent recommendations and personalization
        </h3>
        <p>
            AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to make intelligent recommendations and personalize software experiences. For example, AI-powered recommendation systems are used in e-commerce applications to suggest products based on user preferences and browsing history. Similarly, AI can personalize user interfaces, content, and features based on individual user behavior and patterns.
        </p>
        <h3>
            DevOps and continuous integration
        </h3>
        <p>
            AI has contributed to the evolution of DevOps practices and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. AI techniques can analyze code changes, test results, and production metrics to provide insights on performance, quality, and potential issues. This helps streamline the software development lifecycle, improve deployment processes, and enhance overall software quality.
